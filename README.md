# Titanic Classifications

### Project Description
This project focuses on predicting the survival outcomes of passengers aboard the Titanic using machine learning techniques, particularly an Artificial Neural Network (ANN). The sinking of the Titanic is one of the most infamous shipwrecks in history. On April 15, 1912, during her maiden voyage, the Titanic sank after colliding with an iceberg, resulting in the deaths of a large number of passengers and crew.

The goal of this project is to analyze and predict survival using passenger data such as socio-economic status, age, gender, and other attributes. Through comprehensive data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis (EDA), and the implementation of various machine learning models like Logistic Regression, Random Forest Classifier, Decision Tree Classifier, and an ANN, we aim to determine the factors that influenced survival and build an accurate prediction model.

### Dataset
The dataset used contains information about Titanic passengers, including:

- PassengerId: A unique identifier for each passenger.
- Survived: Whether the passenger survived (1) or not (0).
- TicketClass: The class of the ticket the passenger purchased (1st, 2nd, or 3rd class).
- Name: The name of the passenger.
- Sex: The gender of the passenger.
- Age: The age of the passenger.
- SiblingsSpouse: The number of siblings or spouses aboard the Titanic.
- ParentChildren: The number of parents or children aboard the Titanic.
- Ticket: The ticket number.
- Fare: The amount of money paid for the ticket.
- Cabin: The cabin number where the passenger stayed.
- Embarked: The port where the passenger boarded the Titanic (C = Cherbourg; Q = Queenstown; S = Southampton).

### Approach
- **Data Preprocessing:** Handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, and categorizing age groups.
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):** Visualizing relationships between variables to understand their impact on survival.
- **Model Building:** Implementing machine learning models including Logistic Regression, Random Forest Classifier, Decision Tree Classifier, and an ANN to predict survival.
- **Model Evaluation:** Assessing model performance using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, F1 score, and interpreting results through confusion matrices.
- **Interpretations:** Analyze predictions to understand influential factors like gender, age, and ticket class on survival outcomes.

This project not only aims to build predictive models but also to gain insights into the factors that influenced survival rates during this historic disaster.
